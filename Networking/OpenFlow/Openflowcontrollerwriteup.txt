Assignment: OpenFlow POX Learning Switch Write-Up
12/14/2014

The OpenFlow controller I've written was done using Python and the POX library.
By editing the tutorial controller file in the POX repo, the act_like_switch function
is used to handle packets as opposed to act_like_hub.

The act_like_switch function works by first adding the packet's source port to the
mac_to_port dictionary. If the destination port is NOT in the dictionary, it then 
resends the packet to all port, just as the act_like_hub function did.

If the destination port IS in the dictionary, a flow_mod is set up (msg) that 
sets the match to the attributes of the received packets. 

Two timeouts are also set in the flow_mod, an idle and hard timeout. The idle
timeout (10 seconds) determines how long the flow entry will sit idle before
being deleted. The hard timeout (30 seconds) is the length until the entry
is deleted, regardless of if it is idle or not. 

An action output is then set to send the packet to the correct port (dest_port).

Then the packet is send via the connection (self.connection.send(msg)).
