Ths project was created for and AVD w/ the following specifications:

		5.1 WVGA (480x800:mdpi)
		Android 4.3.1 – API Level 19 (minimum - API 17)
		Skin: WVGA800
		RAM: 512, VM Heap: 32
		Internal Storage: 200
		SD Card Storage: 200
		“Enable” Use Host GPU
		HW Keyboard - NO

No files needed to be accessed externally, as they are all included in the Eclipse
project itself. Running the project is as simple as starting the AVD and building the
project.

Using the application requires nothing but using the touchScreen to interact with buttons
and to scroll on certain screens that require you to do so. 

For the tuner page, when pressing the buttons to get the pitches of the string, the sounds
are slightly delayed, so you won't hear anything until approximately 2 seconds after the button is
pressed. This isn't due to any problems with the code; the mp3 files themselves have a slight
delay.

Further information about using the application is located within the Users' Guide.
