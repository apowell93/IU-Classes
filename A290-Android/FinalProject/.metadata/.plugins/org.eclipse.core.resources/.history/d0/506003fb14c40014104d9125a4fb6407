    <string name="AboutText">The \'Learn Guitar\' application was developed by Jordan Powell as a final project for an Android class
        at Indiana University in the 2014-2015 school year. The goal of the application is to help beginner\'s learn to play guitar 
        as well as for experienced players to use as a reference. The application does not contain all of the data that it could in
        its current state, only enough to give a general idea of how the application will function. The amount of data, lessons, etc.
        that could eventually be added to this application is infinite.</string>

    <!-- Lesson 1 Data Strings  -->
    <string name="Lesson1Text1">\n\rHello and welcome to \'Learn Guitar\'! In this course, I will go over the basics 
    			of learning how to play the guitar, acoustic or electric. In addition to the basic lessons, 
    			I have included sections in the application with chord and scale diagrams, tabs and chords for 
    			several beginner\'s songs, and a tuner to assist you and make sure you don\'t have to jump from 
    			my application to another app or website; you can get all the information you need right here!\n\r</string>
    <string name="Lesson1Text2">\rIn this introduction lesson, I\'m going to show you some basics about reading chord  
    			 diagrams and tabs. We will always be using standard tuning for the beginner\'s lessons. 
    			 In standard tuning, the 6 strings on your guitar, from the top (thickest) string to 
    			 the bottom (thinnest) are as follows: E(6), A(5), D(4), G(3), B(2), E(1).  A phase to help remember 
    			 these string names at first is: (E)very (A)dult (D)og (G)rowls, (B)arks, (E)ats.\n\r</string>
    <string name="Lesson1Text3">\rThe following image is a chord diagram. The chord being shown is A major, but for now
    			 we\'ll just focus on how to read the diagram. Each line represents a string on the guitar, with the
    			 leftmost line being the low E string, or 6th string (thickest). The thick bar at the top represents
    			 the nut of the guitar, which is the piece just before the first fret, generally made of bone or
    			 some form of plastic.\n\r</string>
    <string name="Lesson1Text4">\n\rUnderneath each string is a value. If there is an \'X\', you do not play the string.
    			 If there is a \'0\', you play the string open, or without any fingers on the frets. Otherwise, the 
    			 numbers represent which finger to use to play the fret on the string. The black circles indicate that
    			 you are to play this fret on the guitar. So, with A major, you would play with your 1st 3 fingers on the
    			 second fret of the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th strings, as well as the open 5th and 1st strings.\n\r</string>
    <string name="Lesson1Text5">\n\rThe above is an example of a tab, which is a way to represent the notes played in a song
    			when individual notes are used. The bottom string on the tab diagram is the low E (6th string), and 
    			the top is the high E (1st string). The numbers on the tabs represent the fret to be played, and they
    			are played on the string on which they appear. So, for this tab, you play the 3rd fret, then the 5th fret, 
    			and the 3rd fret again on the high E string first. Then, you play the 5th fret then the 3rd fret on the B
    			string, and so on.\n\r</string>
    <string name="Lesson1Text6">\rThat\'s all for this lesson. I just wanted to give you a basic idea of how to read and understand
    			some of the diagrams and terminology that I\'ll be using throughout these lessons. You\'re now ready for lesson 2!\n\r</string>

    
	<!-- Lesson 2 Data Strings -->
	<string name="Lesson2Text1">\n\rIn this lesson you\'ll be learning how to play 3 chords: E major, D major, and A major. These 3 chords are being used  
				to start because you are able to use an \"anchor\" finger to switch between the three, making it much easier for beginner\'s 
				to switch between chords.\n\r</string>
	<string name="Lesson2Text2">\rTo start, here are the chords diagrams:\n\r</string>
	<string name="Lesson2Text3">\n\rFor A major, the chord diagram says to use fingers 1 (D), 2 (G), and 3 (B)in a row, which is the common method. However, 
				I recommend using the 2nd finger on the D string, 1st on the G string, and 3rd on the B. This makes it easier to fit all three 
				fingers within the same fret. Also, it allows us to use the \"anchor finger\" mentioned above.\n\r</string>
	<string name="Lesson2Text4">\rWhile playing these three chords, you are able to keep your 1st finger down on the G string, only needing to move your 2nd and 3rd 
				fingers to switch chords. Starting with an E chord, you would move your 2nd and 3rd fingers down to the B and high E string, while 
				just sliding your 1st finger over to the second fret to produce a D chord. Moving to an A chord, your first finger is already in 
				the correct position.\n\r</string>
	<string name="Lesson2Text5">\rTo get use to playing these three chords, practice switching between the three before moving on to the next lesson. Practice the 
				\"anchor finger\" technique by keeping your 1st finger down on the string while performing chord switches.\n\r</string>
					<string name="Lesson2Text6">\rA good exercise for practicing chord switches is to do \"minute changes\", which is to choose 2 chords and switch back and forth 
				between the two as many times as you can in one minute. Time yourself doing this each day and see how you progress. Eventually, you should be able to 
				do about 60 changes, or one per second.\n\r</string>
